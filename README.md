# Dark_universe
Proceedings from the HERAEUS summer school about the dark universe (e.g. dark matter and dark energy) held in 2017 in Heidelberg and was funded by the Wilhelm and Else Heraeus foundation. This repository contains exercise sheets, mostly with solutions, small computer simulations and the .tex-files in case you want to edit things.

Please find more information about the summer school as well as this repository in Brems et al. 2018 (in prep.).
